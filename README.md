# ecommerce_site

Wee Shop is an E-Commerce website. I have used functional based components or react hooks in this site. This is a MERN Stack project. For the backend part I used node js and express js. For storing data I use no sql database which is mongodb. After that i have used heroku to deploy this site.

[*Heroku gets slow sometimes. I request you to wait, after a while the live server will open.]

Live server : https://weshopbd.herokuapp.com/
